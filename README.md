# Exploratory-Data-Analysis - DAND-Project-3

This is an old repo for my Data Analysis Nanodegree. It is an exploratory analysis made with Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Data

The data used is a Kaggle dataset from May, 2016.
It contains numerous data concerning appointments for a hospital system, with a boolean representing if the patient did or not show up to the appointment.
